# college_sports_teams
First capstone through Thinkful. Hypothesis testing for expenses to revenue ratios for gendered college sports teams.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Doc Overview 📄</summary>
  There are 2 documents associated with the 1st iteration of this project. There's the slide deck "Expenses and Revenues of College Sports Teams by Gender" and
  a Jupyter Notebook titled "College EtR Ratio Report".
  
  The College EtR Ratio Report (1st version) uses some not-so-stellar coding. There's some brute force and several inefficient for-loops. 
  
  **A 2nd version of this project, with a different hypothesis, is laid out in the third Jupyter notebook, "Overall EtR Ratio Report".
  Code methodologies are much improved in the 2nd version, and demonstrate a clear desire for improving code efficiency.**

  <summary>Background for Version 1 ✨</summary>
  The U.S. Department of Education keeps various records over universities' athletic departments. Gender equity in sports is a commonly discussed topic.
  It's important to consider how we can work to create a more equitable system. As an educational institution, the U.S.     
  Department of Education can gain benefits from seeking to explore the public college system's distribution of finances in a data-driven manner.
  
  # Research Question 🙋🏻
  How many public 4-year universities do not spend an equitable amount of money on their gendered sport teams?
 
  # Null and Alternative Hypotheses👨🏻‍🔬  
  **H0:** On average, public 4-year universities spend the same ratio of funds on women’s teams as men’s teams when normalized by the revenue to
  total revenue ratio that each team brings to the university.
  
  **Ha:** On average, public 4-year universities do not spend the same ratio of funds on women’s teams as men’s teams when normalized by the
  revenue that each team brings to the university.
  
  For a more detailed walkthrough of this project and its results, please head on over to the Jupyter notebook and slide deck, titled
  "College_EtR_Ratio_Report.ipynb" and "Capstone1_Expenses_and_Revenue_of_College_Sports_Teams_by_Gender.pdf", respectively.
  Keep in mind the code needs some work and will be updated.

  <summary>Background for Version 2 ✌🏼</summary>
  In this iteration, we analyze the Expenses to Revenue ratios of the entire system - that is, we develop the ratios by adding
  the expenses and revenues for all colleges by a year. This leaves us with a set of ratios for each sport by gender.
  
  # Research Question 🙋🏻
  For each year from 2010 to 2018, how many sports have a difference in their expenses to revenue ratio by gender?
  
  # Null and Alternative Hypotheses👨🏻‍🔬    
  **H0:** On average, sport teams of public 4-year universities spend the same ratio of funds on men's and women's teams when normalized
  by the ratio of revenue funds.
  
  **Ha:** On average, sport teams of public 4-year universities do not spend the same ratio of funds on men's and women's teams when normalized
  by the ratio of revenue funds.
