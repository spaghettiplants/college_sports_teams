  # Doc Overview ðŸ“„
  There are 2 documents associated with the 1st iteration of this project. There's the slide deck "Expenses and Revenues of College Sports Teams by Gender"
  and the Jupyter Notebook "EtR Ratio Report".
  
  The Jupyter notebook itself uses some not-so-stellar coding. There's some ~brute force~ and several inefficient for loops. The code along with
  another iteration of the project with a slightly different goal will be updated and provided here.
  
  # Background âœ¨
  The U.S. Department of Education keeps various records over universities' athletic departments. Gender equity in sports is a commonly discussed topic.
  It's important to consider how we can work to create a more equitable system. As an educational institution, the U.S.     
  Department of Education can gain benefits from seeking to explore the public college system's distribution of finances in a data-driven manner.
  
  The original research question for this project was: How many public 4-year universities do not spend an equitable amount of money on their gendered sport teams?
  
  This question leads us to the following 2 hypotheses:
  
  H0: On average, public 4-year universities spend the same ratio of funds on womenâ€™s teams as menâ€™s teams when normalized by the revenue to
  total revenue ratio that each team brings to the university.
  
  Ha: On average, public 4-year universities do not spend the same ratio of funds on womenâ€™s teams as menâ€™s teams when normalized by the
  revenue that each team brings to the university.
